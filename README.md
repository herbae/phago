# phago

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/herbae/phago/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/herbae/phago)

A math game involving bacteria and viruses.

You must have Node > 4.x.x installed, since phago uses ECMAScript 6.

Deploy:
npm install

Run:
npm start

Test:
install mocha globally (npm install -g mocha)
npm test or mocha

Simple as that.

You can test a working release at Heroku: http://phago.herokuapp.com. Since Phago has no IA yet, you will probably need two browser windows to actually make any moves.

Have fun!
